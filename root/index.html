            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Formed recently in 2018 in the town of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, Rock’n’Rollin Bike Club is a
                cycling club with great enthusiasm for every part of cycling; from road to downhill cycling. We
                started out as a small band of friends looking for adventure and fitness, meeting here and there
                around the East Midlands, and quickly made friends in all areas of cycling, pushing each other’s
                limits in a race to find thrills.

                We strive to be the benchmark that other clubs want to emulate! After 3 years, the energy for
                cycling in the club has continued to excel and our ethos of the club is simple – to be a home for
                similar individuals, who want to ride their bikes and have a laugh while doing it.

                As a still very active cycling club, we have lots to offer for any newcomer willing to take on the
                cycling world. We have some of the most excellent routes in our area and use applications such as
                Strava, AllTrails and Komoot to helps us guide anyone in the right direction they want to take with
                their cycling.

                We're not all about the newcomers, some of the experienced riders like to challenge themselves
                mentally and physically. If you're setting up for a big event and you need the determination and
                schedule. We could provide that with scheduled fast-paced club rides.

                If any of the above is what you're looking for in a club you not be disappointed there's enough
                experience and members in our club to cater for everyone newbie to racer.
