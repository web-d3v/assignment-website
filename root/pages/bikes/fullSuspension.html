                <h2>An Introduction to Full Suspension Bikes</h2>
                <p>Full suspension bikes, also known as dual suspension or mountain bikes with rear suspension, are
                    specialized bicycles designed to enhance off-road riding experiences. Unlike their rigid or hardtail
                    counterparts, full suspension bikes feature a front suspension fork and a rear shock absorber,
                    creating a system that absorbs impacts and vibrations from uneven terrain. This dual suspension
                    system allows the wheels to move independently, providing better traction, control, and comfort on
                    challenging trails. Full suspension bikes excel in navigating rough and technical terrains, such as
                    rocky descents and root-laden paths, as the suspension helps maintain contact with the ground,
                    improving rider stability and overall handling. These bikes are favored by mountain biking
                    enthusiasts and riders seeking a more forgiving and enjoyable experience on diverse off-road trails.

                <h2>Recommended Apparel</h2>
                <p>When it comes to selecting apparel for full suspension bikes, riders prioritize comfort, protection,
                    and flexibility. A well-ventilated and moisture-wicking cycling jersey is essential, as it helps
                    regulate body temperature during intense rides. Paired with padded cycling shorts or bibs, it
                    ensures comfort on the saddle during extended periods. Full-fingered gloves provide grip, reduce
                    vibrations, and offer protection in case of falls. A quality helmet is non-negotiable for safety,
                    and many riders opt for full-face helmets for additional facial protection, especially during
                    aggressive downhill rides. Protective eyewear shields the eyes from debris, branches, and UV rays.
                    Durable, grippy shoes with a reinforced sole are crucial for maintaining control on the pedals.
                    Depending on the trail and weather conditions, riders might also consider a moisture-resistant and
                    breathable jacket, as well as knee and elbow pads for extra protection. Ultimately, the right
                    apparel for full suspension biking combines functionality, durability, and protection to enhance the
                    overall riding experience.</p>
